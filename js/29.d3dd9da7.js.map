Far too many times\r\n      have students realized that they had 2, 3, or even 4 major tests <i>on the same day</i>!\r\n      Students should never have to sacrifice their ability to demonstrate what they've learned, and\r\n      teachers should never have to see their students stressed, simply because of scheduling\r\n      issues. <br /><br />\r\n      MV Test Tracker exists to help everyone involved in the testing proccess to make better use of\r\n      their time, and to remove as much the stress and uncertainty around it as possible. Our tool\r\n      is made for <i>you</i>, and your feedback and ideas are an essencial part of our mission.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n      Thank you for your support,\r\n      <br />\r\n      <b>The MV Test Tracker Team</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </main>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\nmain.about {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-flow: column nowrap;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-items: flex-start;\r\n}\r\nmain.about .about_header {\r\n  max-width: 600px;\r\n}\r\nmain.about > hr {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  margin: 20px 0;\r\n  border: 0;\r\n  height: 3px;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  opacity: 0.8;\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--color-theme) 50px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 75%);\r\n}\r\n.about_body {\r\n  opacity: 0.8;\r\n  line-height: 1.7em;\r\n  font-family: Lato, Inter, sans-serif;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  max-width: 1000px;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=5f54b668&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5f54b668&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\sande\\\\Documents\\\\GitHub\\\\mvtime.github.io\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-5f54b668\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_hoisted_2","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_5","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
